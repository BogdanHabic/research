# Decentralised Autonomous Organisation Questions

1. What is the DAO Structure?
   1. Single DAO
   2. Hierarchically Structured DAO
   3. Flat-Structure DAOs
2. Are “contributors” also regarded as DAOs? By that, can contributors donate to other contributors?
3. Will DAOs be in the form of a node that participates in consensus?
   1. Advantages
      - Allows each DAO to configure their settings directly based on the node config file.
      - DAOs will have flexibility in terms of how they operate due to config file.
   2. Disadvantages
      - Only a single owner can participate and host the DAO, essentially meaning that it is not exactly a DAO anymore. However, this can be solved by ensuring that a set of nodes associated with the DAO participate in consensus.
4. What is the consensus model of Floyd Economy?
5. What is the DAO Structure Model of Floyd Economy?
6. Can we solve the DAO issuing without creating an application-specific blockchain? By that, can we create secure DAOs by using just smart contracts? What are the benefits of application-specific blockchain as opposed to VM based?
7. How should we be modelling the funds? Can external parties directly request funds from the DAO?

# Decentralised Governance Questions

1. How do coordinating institutions affect plutocracy?

5. What is the organisational structure of Floyd Foundation?
6. How does this relate to the administrative and governmental decisions that occur in Floyd Foundation?
7. How do we solve voting issues such as low voter participation rate?

8. Maybe, we can instead use some sort of relative reputation-based quantification for calculating the voter participation rate

How is this affected by wealth distribution?

Discuss on-chain governance, off-chain governance and how they affect stakeholders such as the node operators

Important Questions
Coin Holder or User? A user that is a coin holder? Where is the line between all of them?

IMPORTANT: Can we extend the architecture to work with different use-cases like the music and art industry? Explore methods to allow other DAO’s to implement a utilitarian optimal DAO solution, Floyd Economy would be the Open-Source Industry, xxx would be for the Music Industry.

IMPORTANT: Can we let 100% of the block rewards to be allocated to the DAOs based on CLR?

Can we allow FF DAO to instead become the Government in the ecosystem in respect to

Off-Chain Governance?

On-Chain Governance?
