## InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)

### What is it?
Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocol used to share data on the distributed web. Hence, it's a system that allows for decentralized sharing of files. Also, IPFS incorporates a Mutable File System (MFS) that allow us to treat files like a trivial name-based filesystem. This solves the issue of having immutable files that were cryptographically enforced (to create the Content Identifier (CID)).

### Why do we need it?
Floyd Economy is to serve a wide variety of the public, from musicians to philosophical authors, all of which require some kind of storage for their public good, a song or an architectural drawing of a temple. All of which, is supposedly free for the world. We believe in some form of inclusion, hence, anything that is to be uploaded onto Floyd Economy is free for the general public. Hence, we concluded that the IPFS will serve as the storage layer for most of the off-chain data. People will be able to query the IPFS and retrieve any file that they wish.

### Requirement of the File System.
#### General
1. Must be able to maintain a large array of files, like
  - mp3,
  - word,
  - ptpx,
  - markdown files
  - etc
2. File's should be immutable in nature, however, some form of upgradeable system must be in place for users to push updates to their files.
  - Will this effect the curation scheme?
3. File's must go through a content curation mechanism before being shown on the website.

#### Sovereignty
1. Also, user's must have sovereign power over their content even though it's for the general public. They should be able to remove it, if they wish so, as this is the basis of human rights and liberalism.

### Problems that may arise?
1. People posting things that are actually "Public Bad".
  - Solution: Content Curation
