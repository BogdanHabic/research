## Business Whitepaper

### Abstract

Floyd Economy serves as an ecosystem of endogenous communities of developers and a collection of decentralised autonomous organisations, also commonly known as “DAOs”, that work coherently to enrich the open-source industry. The decentralised autonomous organisations are community funded entities that are run on publicly auditable source code to ensure complete transparency between the organisations and developers. Developers participate in the DAOs by being investors, whereby, their votings right are proportional to their stake in the DAO.

Essentially, Floyd Economy is a medium for developers and decentralised organisations that create and maintain open-source projects that includes: (i) a system that allows developers to self-manage open source projects through funding, donations, grants, etc; (ii) a proposal scheme that allows developers to pitch their ideas to receive funding from the DAO; (iii) a community-centric dispute resolution scheme that manages fundings, grants, bounties.

The proposal of this open-source ecosystem is a direct response to certain developers (contributors) not being able to generate enough revenue (or remuneration) to be able to sustain their projects in the long run. Also, current open source projects are controlled by various key central stakeholders such as their lead maintainer which dictates: (i) project feature proposal; (ii) how contributors are paid for their work. Henceforth, Floyd Economy solves this hierarchically structured projects by introducing the concepts of DAOs that facilitate the management of administrative requests in the open-source project.

Moreover, Floyd Economy would also like to be blockchain agnostic, meaning that developers should be able to be paid through their preferred currency. Henceforth, Floyd Economy will introduce a more flexible alternative to the traditional decentralised application structure by leveraging existing interoperability protocols.

## Introduction to the Floyd Economy

Floyd Economy proposes a self-organizing ecosystem of developers and decentralised autonomous organisations that focuses on providing neutral and non-authoritarian rules that govern the open-source industry. With that said, Floyd Economy proposes a protocol that allows open-source projects to be publicly funded through concepts of decentralised autonomous organisations to form endogenous communities of developers.

The protocol mentioned above is achieved by building a utilitarian optimal blockchain solution that is built on an application-specific blockchain protocol known as Cosmos. An application-specific blockchain is a blockchain customized to operate a very specific set of functionality, in this case, to store data and functions related to decentralised autonomous organisations. These utilitarian optimal blockchains provide benefits such as sovereignty by ensuring that the endogenous communities of developers and nodes holders are not partitioned. By that, decisions related to governance and administration of the protocol is coherently decided by the developers and stakeholders in the ecosystem.

These type of blockchains are radically different in nature as it removes the security vulnerabilities that exist in virtual-machine blockchains. For example, security issues that are related to smart contracts such as “recursive call bug” are mitigated. Also, smart contracts language are relatively immature and have limited capabilities when programming cryptographic protocols. Hence, using a well-known programming language such as Go, we can ensure that the protocol is built purposefully using well-tested cryptographic libraries. From a performance standpoint, using a well-known deterministic blockchain consensus is very lucrative in this context as it provides the scalability and finality that we require.

## Introduction to the Floyd Foundation Publicly-Auditable Fund

Floyd Foundation, on the other hand, is the decentralised autonomous organisation that governs the governmental and administrative decisions of Floyd Economy. Every developer that joins Floyd Economy will automatically be a member of the Floyd Foundation, meaning that they have proportional rights with every other member in the foundation. This will allow administrative decisions to be collectively decided by each member of the community. In other words, Floyd Foundation aims to be a flat-structured (non-hierarchical) decentralized developer community that focuses on building and maintaining open-source software in a completely transparent manner.

Furthermore, every other DAO that is created in Floyd Economy is a child of the Floyd Foundation DAO. Hence, each member of the Floyd Foundation has the incentive to participate in decisions that occur in each child DAO. Also, child DAOs can create many other child DAOs that operate within the parent DAOs operational logic.

> → Achieving a self-funded DAO through incentivisation and governance: First, talk about the self-funding architecture that allows Floyd Economy to stay funded continually throughout the lifespan of this economy. Then, discuss the benefits of allowing Floyd Economy to be governed by a self-organising decentralised autonomous organistions like not requiring funding from third-parties (VCs, etc). Moreover, the benefits of allowing each individual developer to partake in govermental and adminstrative decisions such as consensus configuration.

> → Achieving Liberal Radicalism through the self-funded DAO by extending concepts of Quadratic Voting: Solves the liberal-communitarian debate in political philosophy by providing neutral and non-authoritarian rules that nonetheless support collective organization. This system would lead to the optimal provision of the founding of self-organizing ecosystem of public goods.

> → Governmental Structure of Floyd Foundation: Stuff goes here…! TBD.
