## Money by Pink Floyd

> “Money, get away,
  Get a good job with good pay and you're okay
  Money, it's a gas
  Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
  New car, caviar, four star daydream
  Think I'll buy me a football team

> Money, get back
  I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack
  Money, it's a hit
  Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
  I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
  And I think I need a Lear jet

> Money, it's a crime
  Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
  Money, so they sayIs the root of all evil today
  But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
  Giving none away, away, away”

This section in the song talks about how people have different incentives when it comes to money.  

Each person dreaming of having luxurious goods.  But, only the rich can. Why? Because nobody can touch his stack.

Each person wants their share of the pie in a fair manner. But does that happen? No.

Try asking for a raise. What happens? You get told to fuck off!

But you put in the time and effort. Is that fair? No.

HAHA! Checkmate you poor little shits. - said every rich guy ever.

So how? What do we do in this day and age to solve this problem?

→ Decentralised Governance

And what does that mean?

→ Incentivise to the community to act in a favourable manner that allows a party to benefit if the community benefits.

Wait, wait, wait. What the fuck does that mean?

→ Good is rewarded with good.

→ Bad is rewarded with bad.
