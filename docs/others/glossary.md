## Glossary

1. Proposal
  * a legitimate business proposal made by a member of the DAO for the benefit of the open-source community
2. Adversarial Proposal
  * a proposal made by an adversary to steal funds from the DAO
3. Contributors
  * a collection of developers and organisations
4. Public Goods
  * a term to describe goods that are made by people as a contribution to society, public goods can be source code, music, art, etc.
  * refer to Quadratic Payments: A Primer for an explanation of public goods as opposed to private goods
5. Public Bad
  * a term to describe bad contribution that is made by people
6. Cycle
  * a period of time
  * also known as an epoch in blockchain systems but for the sake of simplicity we use cycle instead
7. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations
  * A Decentralised Autonomous Organisations; often referred to as "DAO", is a collection of autonomous agents acting independently in a decentralised network that is governed by smart contracts. These smart contracts enforce strict business policies and rules by implementing logic that is cryptographically secure. Essentially, the system ensures that each entity in the system is allocated rights in a fair and distributed manner. The source code governing the DAO is also open-source to encourage complete transparency in a publicly auditable manner.
8. Liveness
  * the period of time that the blockchain will continue working (producing new blocks)
9. Block Reward
  * rewards that are given to miners that contribute to the consensus of the blockchain
10. Open Source Software
  * An open source project is an umbrella term that includes software whose source code is published and made available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify and redistribute the source code with or without conditions.
11. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations
  * A Decentralised Autonomous Organisations; often referred to as "DAO", is a collection of autonomous agents acting independently in a decentralised network that is governed by cryptographically enforced contracts. These contracts take shape in the form of open-source software which enforces strict business policies and rules by implementing logic directly into the source code. Essentially, the system ensures that each entity in the system is allocated rights in a fair and distributed manner as written in source code. Moreover, the source code governing the DAO is also completely transparent in a publicly auditable manner.
12. Decentralised Applications
  * A Decentralised Application; often referred to as “dApps”, is an application that utilizes blockchain to ensure immutability and transparency between the users. It excels for certain use-cases, e.g issuing non-fungible tokens, however, it can be really expensive to develop full-fledged dApps. Moreover, dApps very commonly utilizes smart contracts that virtual-machine based blockchains offer to provide an extensive list of features.
