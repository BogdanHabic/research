# Upala

## Identity Model of Upala

Upala exists as a **digital identity uniqueness score**. It's built based of the concept of groups, whereby, users are allowed to join groups. A collection of groups can join a group. Essentially, creating a hierarchically structured social graph of groups and users.

Author also claims that one of the advantage of Upala, is the ability to wrap it around existing DAO's and Identity systems such as BrightID, HumanityDAO and Idena.

Based on price of personhood, wherebby, the identity is represented by a price that reflects the identity score.


## Protocol and Universe.

Upala works out to be a protocol, hence, it's possible to wrap this around everything, and build forward from there. The protocol is based on the concept of **bot reward**, whereby, any user can try to acquire this reward from others by attack them. The groups are somewhat there to represent scores of the individuals in the group, and this score represents users trust. Hence, the groups have value as well, or, a pool of something arbitrary (not sure, might just be monetary value).

Hence, the bot explosion rules are defined in the contract for these properties
1. maintain a pool of money
2. provide member scores
3. reward an exploding bot with a portion of a pool
