# BrightID

## Universal Proof of Uniqueness
Social Identity Network that allows people to prove that their existence is singular. This means that users have to prove that they aren't connected with more than one account. Hence, BrightID incorporates a solution that enables the creation and analysis of a social graph.

### Principles
1. Nonintrusive - data not centralised, essentially meaning that it is shared peer-to-peer.
2. Decentralized - solution is not controlled by a single organisation
3. Open - open-source, hence, auditable
4. Resuable - should be modular

### Properties of the Social Graph
BrightID's solution creates a peer-to-peer bidirectional connection between two people that is cryptographically signed by both. Groups and Seeds are included where the former are preselected points in the graph that enforce trust flows. The latter is the combined effort of connected users to help someone become verified.

The social graph is a combination of stars (reputation) and staking (star-based staking). This ensures that users must stake (reputation) as a fight to prove their uniqueness. Then, the Proof of Uniquessness awards them with more stars (reputation).


## Problems with BrightID
1. Applications that integrate BrightID first, will have to pay a higher onboarding fees as the user's have yet to be "created" in BrightID.
2. Limited capabilties at the moment, as it doesn't have any docs on integration with applications.
