## Introduction
Floyd Economy has gone through several iterations of thought-based experiments conducted through non-empirical means. However, each time a considerable amount of effort was allocated in understanding certain psychological aspects of human behaviour in a radical approach of building societies that are altruistic in nature. Hence, it's important to understand that Floyd Economy is not a company, or an entity, instead, it is as a **movement** that started out from the Ethereum community, which is a perfect example of a community of developers that are **collectivistic** in nature. With the introduction of Gitcoin and Panvala, we can clearly see a large impact of collaboration from developers, enthusiasts and like-minded people in achieving a degree of sustainability in public good projects.

## Sustainability of Public Goods
It's pretty evident that the Ethereum Foundation and Gitcoin has successfully built a sustainable public good funding mechanism through the concept of Grants. With that, we can see the community come together as a collective and contribute to projects in terms of monetary funding and software development. That should prove that we are currently experiencing a radical reformation of the society, moreso, from individualism to collectivism. This radical movement is so a powerful factor in the Ethereum community, as it drives the production of public goods, in this case, the development of open-source software.
