# Floyd Economy

### Summary
-  A self-funded philanthropic economy
- An endogenous community of developers that conform to neutral and non-authoritative rules
- A censorship-resistant public goods platform

### The Problem Space
This section of the document should be treated as a conceptual document. Things here are bound to change and nothing is permanent.


### What we set out to solve?
The main issues that exist in open source software and decentralised autonomous organisations are highlighted here.

1. Public Goods
  * Sustainability issues related to public goods
  * Lack of incentives to contribute to public goods
  * Reducing public goods projects administrative costs
  * Free-Rider Problem
2. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)
  * Security vulnerabilities of issuing smart contracts to facilitate DAO
  * Plutocracy that occurs in decentralized governance
  * Non-colluding endogenous communities of developers

**IMPORTANT CAVEAT**: This project first started out as a solution to the sustainability issues that exist within the open-source software industry. However, while solving the sustainability issue, we noticed that this solution is applicable to a variety of public goods through concepts related to philanthropic liberalism. Henceforth, some parts of this document highlight open-source software, however, that should be taken with a grain of salt. Instead, refer to those parts as public goods instead of open-source software.ÂmM

Also, it’s worth noting that most of the concepts and decisions that are made in this document are to solve the sustainability issues that exists in public good platforms.
