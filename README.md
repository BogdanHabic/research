## DISCLAIMER: CONCEPTUAL PHASE (WIP)

The following document provides context and information about open source software (OSS) and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).

## Glossary

### Open Source Software

An open source project is an umbrella term that includes software whose source code is published and made available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify and redistribute the source code with or without conditions.

### Decentralised Autonomous Organisations

A Decentralised Autonomous Organisations; often referred to as "DAO", is a collection of autonomous agents acting independently in a decentralised network that is governed by cryptographically enforced contracts. These contracts take shape in the form of open-source software which enforces strict business policies and rules by implementing logic directly into the source code. Essentially, the system ensures that each entity in the system is allocated rights in a fair and distributed manner as written in source code. Moreover, the source code governing the DAO is also completely transparent in a publicly auditable manner.

### Decentralised Applications

A Decentralised Application; often referred to as “dApps”, is an application that utilizes blockchain to ensure immutability and transparency between the users. It excels for certain use-cases, e.g issuing non-fungible tokens, however, it can be really expensive to develop full-fledged dApps. Moreover, dApps very commonly utilizes smart contracts that virtual-machine based blockchains offer to provide an extensive list of features.

   - PDF: [/ECONS/1.pdf](./ECONS/1.pdf)
   - Paper: [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06421.pdf)
   - Overview
     - Design for philanthropic or publicly-funded seeding to allow (near) optimal provision of a decentralized, self-organizing ecosystem of public goods
     - Concepts extend ideas from Quadratic Voting (QV) mechanism
