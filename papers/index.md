# Achieving Sustainability of Public Goods through Philanthropic Liberal Radicalism (PLR)

---

## DISCLAIMER: CONCEPTUAL PHASE (WIP)

The following document provides context and information about Floyd Economy. It worth pointing out the research first started off by trying to solve the sustainability issue that exists in open-source software. Then, the research moved to utilising decentralised governance systems such as decentralised autonomous orgnisations to solve sustainability. By doing so, we decide to explore different use cases (such as art and music industry) that we can apply this solution to.
